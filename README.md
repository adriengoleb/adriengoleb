I’m passionate about Data Science, Machine Learning and more generally about the Artificial Intelligence (AI) and their applications in the Computer vision and NLP fields (Visual Question Answering). I am particularly interested in Deep Learning technologies and their interpretabilities. Sensitive to the **frugal AI** and the **trustworthy AI**, AI for mission-critical systems is an exciting subject in the industry field.

Particularly interested to the weakly supervised learning strategies  : **domain adaptation**, self supervision, n-shot learning...

<br>

* 🔎 I am looking for a position as an **AI Engineer** or **PHD** position for Data Science and Machine learning missions in industry and aeronautical fields ✈️
<br>

*   🧠  I'am very enthusiastic to solve real-world problems. As a self-learner and open source enthusiast, I constantly seek to sharpen my knowledge and            gain new skills. I never stop learning 📚. 

<br>

*   🔭 I'm **working on a community project: IAZ, writing and organizing AI courses from A to Z** for a French speaking audience : https://github.com/adriengoleb/ia-z and participate to writing scientific articles on "**la revue IA**" https://larevueia.fr/ about frugal AI and Domain adaptation. I continue to improve my skills in data analysis through different projects in the sport field.
