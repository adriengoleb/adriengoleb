<br>

I’m passionate about Machine Learning, Statistical learning and more generally about the Artificial Intelligence (AI) and their applications. I would like to use my skills acquired in AI during my studies to work in the field of applied research in companies. I am particularly interested in Deep Learning technologies to answer industrial and/or environmental problems.

<br>


*   🌍  I'm based in **Paris**.

<br>

*   🧠  Recently graduated, I'am very enthusiastic to solve real-world problems. As a self-learner and open source enthusiast, I constantly seek to sharpen my knowledge and            gain new skills. I never stop learning 📚. 

<br>

*   🔭 Outside of my school classes, I’m currently working on training differents neural networks structures (RNN,CNN) for a music genre differentiation and **working            on a community project: IAZ, writing and organizing AI courses from A to Z** for a French speaking audience : https://github.com/adriengoleb/ia-z
