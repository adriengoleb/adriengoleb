I’m passionate about Machine Learning, Statistical learning and more generally about the Artificial Intelligence (AI) and their applications. I never stop learning 📚. Attention is all I need. Very enthusiastic to solve real-world problems. As a self-learner and open source enthusiast, I constantly seek to sharpen my knowledge and gain new skills.
