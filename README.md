<h1 align="center">Hi, I'm Adrien Golebiewski</h1>
<h4 align="center">I'm Adrien Golebiewski @adriengoleb, a computer science engineer, Data Science Graduate🎓 and I am doing a research master's degree in artificial intelligence at PSL University (joint program Dauphine, Mines de Paris, ENS Ulm) in 2022/2023. </h4>




I’m passionate about Machine Learning and more generally about the Artificial Intelligence (AI) and their applications in the Computer vision and NLP fields (Visual Question Answering). I am particularly interested in Deep Learning technologies and their interpretabilities. Sensitive to the **frugal AI** and the **trustworthy ia**, AI for mission-critical systems is an exciting subject in the industry field.

Particularly interested to the weakly supervised learning strategies  : **domain adaptation**, self supervision, n-shot learning...

<br>

* 🔎 I am also looking for a position as an **AI Research Engineer R&D/R&T** for the year 2023 in these fields.

<br>

*   🧠  I'am very enthusiastic to solve real-world problems. As a self-learner and open source enthusiast, I constantly seek to sharpen my knowledge and            gain new skills. I never stop learning 📚. 

<br>

*   🔭 I’m currently doing a research intership in Safran Tech and I'm working on the adaptation of deep learning model on segmentation tasks applied to adverse conditions in the autonomous vehicle field. In parallel, I'm **working on a community project: IAZ, writing and organizing AI courses from A to Z** for a French speaking audience : https://github.com/adriengoleb/ia-z and participate to writing scientific articles on "**la revue IA**" https://larevueia.fr/ about frugal AI and Domain adaptation. I continue to improve my skills in data analysis through different projects in the sport field.

<br>

*   🤝  I'm open to collaborating on meaningful AI projects
