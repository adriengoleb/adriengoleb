<br>

I’m passionate about Machine Learning and more generally about the Artificial Intelligence (AI) and their applications in Computer Vision. I am particularly interested in Deep Learning technologies and by the **frugal AI** with low or no labels and its learning strategies associated : domain adaptation, self supervision, n-shot learning...

<br>

I am also looking for a **Cifre thesis contract** for the year 2023 in these fields.

<br>


*   🌍  I'm based in **Paris**.

<br>

*   🧠  I'am very enthusiastic to solve real-world problems. As a self-learner and open source enthusiast, I constantly seek to sharpen my knowledge and            gain new skills. I never stop learning 📚. 

<br>

*   🔭 I’m currently doing a research intership in Safran Tech and I'm working on the adaptation of deep learning model on segmentation tasks applied to adverse conditions in the autonomous vehicle field. In parallel, I'm **working on a community project: IAZ, writing and organizing AI courses from A to Z** for a French speaking audience : https://github.com/adriengoleb/ia-z and participate to writing scientific articles on "**la revue IA**" about frugal AI and Domain adaptation. I continue to improve my skills in data analysis through different projects 

<br>

*   🤝  I'm open to collaborating on meaningful AI projects
