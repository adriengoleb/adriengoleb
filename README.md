I’m passionate about Data Science, Machine Learning and more generally about the Artificial Intelligence (AI) and their applications in the Computer Vision fields. I am particularly interested in Deep Learning technologies and their interpretabilities. Sensitive to the **frugal AI** and the **trustworthy AI**, AI for mission-critical systems is an exciting subject in the industry field.

Particularly interested to the weakly supervised learning strategies  : **domain adaptation**, self supervision, n-shot learning...

*   🧠  I'am very enthusiastic to solve real-world problems. As a self-learner and open source enthusiast, I constantly seek to sharpen my knowledge and            gain new skills. I never stop learning 📚.
